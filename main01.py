what 'its' favorite color is. After I put that in the program will
end as there is no more code.'''

''' The program did exactly what I said it would do above. I know the
program took my guess but I don't think it stored it as the 
input has no variable connected to it, so it probably immediately
deleted it afterwards.'''
